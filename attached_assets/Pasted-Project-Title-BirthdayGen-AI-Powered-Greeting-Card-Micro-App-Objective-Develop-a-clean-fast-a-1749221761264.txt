Project Title: BirthdayGen - AI-Powered Greeting Card Micro-App

Objective: Develop a clean, fast, and mobile-first single-page web application that generates personalized birthday messages using an AI model. The primary goal is to capture users from social media and convert them to a low-cost digital product purchase.

Core Tech Stack:

Frontend: React with Vite (TypeScript preferred).
Styling: Tailwind CSS for a modern, utility-first approach.
Deployment: Netlify (continuous deployment from a GitHub repository).
Backend & Database: Supabase. Use it for the database call and potentially an Edge Function to house the AI logic.
Payments: Integrate Lemon Squeezy for its simplicity with digital products.
User Flow (The "Flywheel Capture"):

Landing View:
A large, compelling headline: "Never send a boring birthday text again."
Sub-headline: "Get a unique, AI-powered message in seconds."
A simple, two-field form:
Input 1 (Text): "Who is the message for?" (Placeholder: "e.g., My sister, my boss, my dog")
Input 2 (Text): "Describe them in a few words." (Placeholder: "e.g., Loves coffee, funny, a total rockstar")
A single, prominent "Generate Message" button.
Generation & Freemium Offer:
When "Generate" is clicked, the button shows a loading spinner.
An API call is made to a backend endpoint (ideally a Supabase Edge Function).
The backend sends the user's input to the OpenAI API (using the "Gennie" persona prompt).
The backend receives the AI response and sends ONE high-quality message back to the frontend.
The frontend displays this single message clearly.
Conversion & Monetization:
Simultaneously with displaying the free message, a modal window or a section below appears with a clear offer:
Headline: "Love it? There's more."
Offer: "Unlock 5 more premium, personalized messages + a beautiful, downloadable digital card for just $2.99."
Button: A bright "Unlock Now" button that links directly to the Lemon Squeezy checkout page for this product.
Fulfillment (Post-Purchase):
After successful payment, the user is redirected to a "Thank You" page on the app.
This page displays the 5+ premium messages.
It includes a "Download Your Card" button, which links to a pre-designed digital card (a PDF or PNG hosted in Supabase Storage) where they can copy/paste their favorite message.
Design & UI/UX:

Theme: Clean, modern, joyful, and slightly playful. Use a bright color palette (e.g., yellows, pinks, light blues).
Font: A friendly, readable sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Nunito).
Mobile-First: The entire experience must be flawless on a mobile device, as 99% of traffic will come from TikTok/Instagram.
Minimalism: No navigation, no footer, no distractions. The entire app is focused on the single user flow.
Backend Logic (for the Supabase Edge Function):

The function must accept target and description as inputs.
It must securely store and use the OpenAI API key (as an environment variable).
It should contain the "Gennie" system prompt.
It must be optimized for a fast response time.
Final Deliverable:
A GitHub repository containing the complete source code for the React/Vite frontend and the Supabase Edge Function, ready to be deployed on Netlify.
